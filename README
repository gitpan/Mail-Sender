Version 0.6.7

Known problems :
 The module doesn't work woth qmail, the cause of the problem is known,
 but the fix requires an almost complete rewrite.
 The problem is that the module understands only one-line responses
 from the SMTP server and qmail is very talkative.

Future plans:
 I would like to rewrite the module completely to clean up the code and
 add better error handling. During that I'll add also timeouts and stuff.
 I don't know when will I have time to do that :-(

Revision history for Perl extension Mail::Sender.

I am sorry I did not keep track of the changes :-(

Version 0.4 :
 I added several methods for most common tasks.
  MailMsg : Send a string as a mail by single call
  MailFile : The same plus attached files
  SendFile : Insert a file as a part of a multipart message
  Send(Line)Enc : Automatic encoding (Base64,Quoted-Printable)

Version 0.5 :
 Cancel : cancel an Opened message.
 $sender->{'error'} : last error for this object.
 @Errors : a list of error messages.
 Several minor fixes.
 
Version 0.6 :
 fixed problems with Base64 encoding. Files are now read, encoded and
 sent in parts instead of whole at once. You may call SendEnc several
 times in one part now.

...

Version 0.6.6 : Added support for CC: and BCC:.

Version 0.6.9b : 7/19/1999 - BETA
 Open(), MailMsg and MailFile accept ctype, and encoding parameters.

 You have more options in Part() and Body(). It's possible to send HTML
 mails with inlined images easily now.

 Error -5 (Unspecified communication error) now includes the actual
 error returned by the mail server.

 Some more examples in the docs.

 Mail::Sender now tries to guess the content type for attached files.

 You may now create not only multipart/mixed but also multipart/related
 or other messages.

Version 0.7.00
 Mail/Sender.config file may be used to set up default options for
 new Mail::Sender. You may install a function that gets called for every
 message.

Version 0.7.01 - 12/9/1999
 bugfix (qmail would not accept attachments)

Version 0.7.02 - 8/1/19100
 bugfix
  Don't tell me I'm stuuupid, I know it. Ever tried to send en email
  with a line consisting of only a single dot?

Version 0.7.03 - 14/1/19100
 bugfix
  Don't tell me I'm stuuupid, I know it. As Jan Starzynski <jan@planet.de>
  pointed out it ate the last character on each line in SendEx() (Used in SendFile)
  under Unix. Oh well :-(

Version 0.7.04 - 8/1/19100
 bugfix
  A fix only in the configuration script because of some unimportant
  problems with PPM instalation. No change to the module itself.

Version 0.7.05 - 25/1/19100
 Added fake_from, fake_to and fake_cc options to
 new/Open/OpenMultipart/MailMsg/MailFile.
 This allows you to send a message to a list of people, while including
 only the list name/address in the headers. The fake_... may be whatever
 text you like, doesn't need to look like an address.

Version 0.7.06 
 bugfix
 
Version 0.7.07 - 4/4/2001
 bugfix
 Fixed a stupid bug related to multipart messages (have you ever used one hash item 
 for two different purposes? I AM that stupid!)

Version 0.7.08 - 4/10/2001
 doc fix

Version 0.7.09 - 6/28/2001
 minor fixes

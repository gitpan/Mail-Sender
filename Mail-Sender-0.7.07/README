Mail::Sender - module for sending mails with attachments through an SMTP server
Version 0.7.07

Known problems :
 The module sometimes doesn't work with qmail, the cause of the problem
 is known,  but the fix requires an almost complete rewrite.
 The problem is that the module understands only one-line responses
 from the SMTP server and qmail is very talkative.
 This depends on the set up, I've had a few success reports on qmail.
 
Future plans:
 I would like to rewrite the module completely to clean up the code and
 add better error handling. During that I'll add also timeouts and stuff.
 I don't know when will I have time to do that :-(
